# Effects of roads and forest successional age on species in an experimental plant invasion

Seedlings of six species (3 invaders, 3 natives) were planted at 12 forest sites classified as mature (>60 years) or young (<40 years). A 60-meter long transect perpendicular to the road was established at each site. We planted four seedlings of each species at distances of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 meters from the roadway edge. The 24 seedlings were planted in a 8 x 3 grid with the long edge parallel to the road at each distance, with at least four meters between plants.

@Avon2010 found that the main road effect on understory plant diversity extended <5 m into the forest stand. Ultimately, they delineated 3 habitats: the road verge leading up to the exact edge between the roadway and forest stand, the forest-road edge (0 - 5 m), and the forest interior. 

 - Maybe we should redefine our edge/interior classifcation to have three classes (e.g. 0, 5-10, 20-60, or 0-5, 10-20, 40-60)?

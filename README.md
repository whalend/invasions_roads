# Edge effects on species in an experimental plant invasion

The data for this paper are from the experiment described in @Flory2010. They put these data in the context of how roads and forest successional age may affect plant invasions. They reported the data in aggregate, i.e., grouping the three native species and three non-native species. 

In this paper we want to provide the breakdown by species, which will provide insight into the (dis)similarity in species responses.

## Experimental design
Seedlings of six species (3 invaders, 3 natives) were planted at 12 forest sites classified as mature (>60 years) or young (<40 years). A 60-meter long transect perpendicular to the road was established at each site. We planted four seedlings of each species at distances of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 meters from the roadway edge. The 24 seedlings were planted in a 8 x 3 grid with the long edge parallel to the road at each distance, with at least four meters between plants.


## Review of edge effects


@Avon2010 found that the main road effect on understory plant diversity extended <5 m into the forest stand. Ultimately, they delineated 3 habitats: the road verge leading up to the exact edge between the roadway and forest stand, the forest-road edge (0 - 5 m), and the forest interior. 

 - Maybe we should redefine our edge/interior classifcation to have three classes (e.g. 0, 5-10, 20-60, or 0-5, 10-20, 40-60)?
 
 - It seems that something to separate out the 0 m location would make sense.
